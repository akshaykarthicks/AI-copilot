# Module: accounts.py

This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform.

## Class: Account

This class represents a user's account.

### Attributes:

* `balance`: float, the current balance of the account.  Initialized to 0.0.
* `holdings`: dict, a dictionary where keys are stock symbols (strings) and values are the number of shares held (integers). Initialized to an empty dictionary.
* `transactions`: list, a list of dictionaries, each representing a transaction. Each transaction dictionary has the following keys:
    * `type`: string, either "deposit", "withdrawal", "buy", or "sell".
    * `symbol`: string, the stock symbol (only for buy and sell transactions).
    * `quantity`: int, the number of shares (only for buy and sell transactions).
    * `price`: float, the price per share at the time of the transaction (only for buy and sell transactions).
    * `amount`: float, the amount of money involved in the transaction.
* `initial_deposit`: float, the initial deposit made into the account. Initialized to 0.0.


### Methods:

* `__init__(self, initial_deposit=0.0)`: Constructor. Initializes the account with an optional initial deposit.  Sets `initial_deposit` attribute.

* `deposit(self, amount)`: Deposits funds into the account.  Adds the amount to `balance` and records the transaction. Raises a `ValueError` if amount is not positive.

* `withdraw(self, amount)`: Withdraws funds from the account. Subtracts the amount from `balance`. Raises a `ValueError` if amount is greater than `balance` or if the resulting balance would be negative. Records the transaction.


* `buy(self, symbol, quantity, price)`: Buys shares of a stock.  Calculates the cost, subtracts from the balance, adds the shares to `holdings`. Raises a `ValueError` if the user cannot afford the purchase or if `quantity` or `price` are not positive. Records the transaction.

* `sell(self, symbol, quantity, price)`: Sells shares of a stock. Adds the proceeds to the balance, subtracts the shares from `holdings`. Raises a `ValueError` if the user does not own enough shares or if `quantity` or `price` are not positive. Records the transaction.


* `get_portfolio_value(self)`: Calculates the total value of the portfolio based on current share prices using `get_share_price()`. Returns a float.

* `get_profit_loss(self)`: Calculates the profit or loss of the portfolio compared to the initial deposit. Returns a float.

* `get_holdings(self)`: Returns the `holdings` dictionary.

* `get_transactions(self)`: Returns the `transactions` list.


## Function: get_share_price(symbol)

This function returns the current price of a share for a given symbol.  It includes a test implementation for AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.

```python
def get_share_price(symbol):
    """Returns the current price of a share for a given symbol.

    Args:
        symbol: str, the stock symbol.

    Returns:
        float, the current price of the share.  Returns None if the symbol is unknown.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the symbol is invalid.
    """
    #Test implementation
    prices = {"AAPL": 150.0, "TSLA": 1000.0, "GOOGL": 2500.0}
    if symbol in prices:
        return prices[symbol]
    else:
        return None

```

## Example Usage

```python
from accounts import Account, get_share_price

account = Account(10000.0)  # Create an account with an initial deposit of $10,000
account.deposit(5000.0)
account.buy("AAPL", 10, get_share_price("AAPL"))
account.sell("AAPL", 5, get_share_price("AAPL"))
print(account.get_portfolio_value())
print(account.get_profit_loss())
print(account.get_holdings())
print(account.get_transactions())

```
